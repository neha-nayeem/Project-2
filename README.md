## Topic and Rationale 🌃🔪🩸📝
* As residents of Toronto, we want to gain insights on Toronto safety and crime rates in different neighborhoods.
* After completion of project 1, we are equipped with more skills that will allow us to further analyze and visualize different type of charts interactively.

## Datasets 🗃
* [Toronto Police Open Data](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/open-data)
